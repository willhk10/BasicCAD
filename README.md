I made a [caster](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/2450def9f817c9f725a31395/w/bd5d2351defea85021d20a5a/e/ca8e8d6df98edfaf2fcfceb1) again, but in a different software. Kind of like going from French to Spanish.

## ***Description***

This was actually a lot easier than I thought it was. I thought that it would be hard on OnShape due to the change of platform, but i got used to it very quickly.

# [Mount](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/46768d04d362090ab351408f/w/5d21ce23e3a017efa8838628/e/8457bd39094742190d14fda0)
<img src="Pictures/Yes/MountEngineering.png" alt="alt text" width="400" height="400">

## ***Description***

The mount was very easy to make. I didn't use the method that Mr. H explained to me as I thought it was a bit confusing and I didn't want to mess it up. I ended up just making a new part and copying over the dimensions and sketch geometry.

# [Fork](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/589f920685521cb794707851/w/2c120b6b5092ad41d9c81965/e/22497d4e152375cd2abb89d0)

## ***Description***

This part was really easy to make. I remembered exactly how to do it from last year, so it only took about 20 minutes. However, when I dimensioned the distances of the rectangles, I used the wrong pieces of the rectangles and I only noticed this when I got to the assembly. I accidentally dimensioned the centerline to the middle of the rectangle rather than the side of it.

# [Tire](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/38021a99b790bc8086a8d479/w/79e3e6747ae8a860df2d6428/e/364541b5f4b31d74922dffb3)

## ***Description***

This part took less than 5 minutes to make. I remembered the revolve function and it was very simple sketch-wise.

# [Wheel](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/16a0348281fc257c5c3b8d33/w/c7f5b91de47021ddd09ca707/e/e3989c2135b0927816098c76)
<img src="Pictures/Yes/WheelEngineering.png" alt="alt text" width="400" height="400">

## ***Description***

This part was also very simple, as it used the revolve feature. I spent roughly 5 minutes on this part, and all that was challenging was getting the mates and making the shape fully constrained.

***Description***

This was very simple, as it was basically just two extruded concentric circles.

# [Wheel and Axel](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/851d373919ec8b08767eca46/w/10bab2ed09746d293d2c519a/e/8f4c1beb489d9aea29b5063f)

## ***Description***

Learning how to do the new mates was actually really fun and I learned how to do it extremely fast. I spent probably 15 minutes on it in total. When I was mating the axel with the wheel, however, I did not select the center of the wheel, resulting in a very slight offset of the axel. This was only apparent when I added on the bearings and one side has extra axel and the other was short. I could barely see this when I was looking at the whole assembly, but when I zoomed in really close and used the measure tool, I could see that there was a small offset. I fixed this by deleting the mate and remating the center of the axel to the proper center of the wheel.

## ***Description***

This was overall an extremely fun project and I had a lot of fun remaking all the pieces in Onshape rather than Solidworks. I really enjoyed the different ways that you import standard items and mate things.

# Takeaway

In the end, I learned so much about Onshape. I learned how to use the new mates, how to sketch, extrude, revolve, and almost all the basics of Onshape. I prefer Onshape over Solidworks because it is much more friendly to beginners, and it is much easier to get things done. One thing that I would like to avoid next time is using the wrong parts of a sketch as dimension material. This can be easily avoided by just double checking your work

 ## Description of Pins
  This project was quite easy, as I just had to figure out how to make the dowel rods and use configurations, which was much easier than SolidWorks, and then make the frame, which was just basic math and engineering. The only problem that I had was that I didn't make the frame wide enough many times, so the frame was actually bigger than the picture area.
